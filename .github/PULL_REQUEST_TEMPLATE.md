**PLEASE REMOVE THE BELOW CHECKLIST BEFORE SUBMITTING**

IMPORTANT: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.

* Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
* You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/cudart_spec_build` or `feature/rdma_channel`.
* You have only one or a small number of commits (if not, squash some into one commit).
* Linter doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first (e.g. `./scripts/check_cpp_format.sh -fix .`) and amend your commit (`git commit --amend`).
